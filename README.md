# Vehicle Tracking System Installation
  
However, depending on your reasons for using a GPS tracker, you might not want it to be in permanent view. Portable tracker batteries need changing every few months so, wherever the tracker is located, it should be accessible. If discretion is a priority, a **hardwired GPS tracker** is the way to go.

Use the pick tool to create a small gap between the exposed copper wires. Take the exposed end of the red wire on your GPS tracking device and thread it through the newly-created gap in the constant power wire. Wrap any loose copper wire ends together and cover the connection with a piece of electrical tape.
 
While it might seem like a leap, car trackers can really come in handy in these times of fluctuating fuel costs. Whether prices are high or low, car trackers can help you assess the efficiency of routes, and determine the best way that your fleet of vehicles can save money.
 
Installing a car tracker involves three simple steps: accessing the ignition and power wires under the dashboard, hardwiring your device, and reassembling your dashboard. It can be a bit tricky, but we hope our detailed step-by-step guide will help you get started on your vehicle tracking journey.
 
Collect precise data on vehicle location, speed, trip distance and time, engine idling and more with the GO9. Even if you park a vehicle indoors and underground, advanced GPS vehicle tracking and telematics starts recording as soon as you begin driving. The GO9 introduces the new Global Navigation Satellite System module (GNSS) for faster latch times and increasingly accurate location data.

Extract valuable vehicle health information within our fleet vehicle tracking system. Capture and record the vehicle identification number (VIN), odometer reading, engine faults and more. This data helps you prioritize vehicle maintenance and audit vehicle use to identify both safe and risky driving behaviors.
 
GO9 offers harsh-event data (such as aggressive acceleration, braking or cornering) and collision reconstruction through its accelerometer and our patented algorithms. If GO9 detects a suspected collision, it will automatically upload detailed data that enables forensic reconstruction of the event. This includes in-vehicle reverse collisions. Email and desktop alerts signal the first notice of loss.
 
Improve driving behaviors, such as following speed limits and reducing idling time, by playing an audible alert. GO9 also enables you to coach the driver with spoken words (available as an Add-On). Immediate driver feedback can enhance fleet safety, reinforce company policy and encourage your drivers to take immediate corrective action.
 
Vehicles send data from a multitude of sources, including the engine, drivetrain, instrument cluster and other subsystems. Utilizing multiple internal networks, the GO9 captures and organizes much of this data.
 
The hardwired Quartix tracking device is usually installed by a trained engineer. Although this is a quick process, it does require a small amount of vehicle downtime while our installers come on site to fix the devices into place. We also offer guidance on how to install this yourself.
 
Establishing the physical requirements of your fleet will help you choose between the three types of devices available with Quartix. A good place to start is considering whether you would like your tracking devices to be hardwired into the vehicles or if you need the flexibility of a self-installed device.
 
Depending on the types of vehicle that make up your fleet, the hardwired tracker may be better suited. Our self-install vehicle trackers are suitable for cars and vans, whereas the hardwired device is compatible with all vehicle models.
 
Several additional features are available with the hardwired vehicle tracker, such as alerts for emergency door openings or tailgate lifts. If you would benefit from these features, you may decide on our engineer installed tracker.
 
The Quartix hardwired vehicle tracking device measures 9cm x 5.5cm x 2.4cm, and weighs just 90g. The unit is completely hidden from view following installation, which typically takes our trained installers 30-40 minutes.
 
Once installed by an engineer, the hardwired device is extremely difficult to tamper with. It also gives the option of additional functionality, such as driver ID key fob readers and warnings for tailgate lifts.
 
For customers who require their tracking devices to be moved from one vehicle to another on a regular basis, self-installed devices are the most practical option; they are portable and require no installation appointment to get started.
 
Quartix offers two different self-install tracking devices, each one providing the same live tracking and basic reports as the hardwired unit, but without the specialised features. Learn more about our self-install device options below.
 
Apart from anti-theft purposes, businesses use GPS tracking systems to monitor the behaviour of their drivers, fuel usage, and routes taken. **GPS installation** gives you insights about speeding, harsh braking, cornering, etc., helping you closely monitor reckless driving habits and providing extra coaching to improve driving skills. So, you will instantly come to know the next time your teen kid is overspeeding.
 
However, many car owners are sceptical about **installing GPS trackers** because they think they need the necessary technical knowledge to attach one. Whether you use your GPS tracking device for security or tracking real-time location, **car tracker installation** is easy, and they work without a hitch.
 
After **GPS tracker installation**, tracking devices pick up the signals from the GPS satellites to deliver precise real-time locations. Cloud-based tracking software stores all the essential data sent by the tracking device to display them whenever necessary.
 
Detailed information such as speed, movement, location, and direction can be accessed anytime. Using the geofence zone feature, you can set up digital zones on the map and opt. in to get notified whenever a vehicle enters or leaves the geofenced area.
 
Experts recommend seeking the advice of a **vehicle electronics professional**, especially if you want to install multiple devices in many fleet vehicles. However, if you are planning to **install tracker on car**, there are certain factors you need to consider before you start the process.
 
Deciding the location of the device is essential because if you install the tracker in a spot where there is interference or obstacles that block **satellite signals**, the accuracy of the vehicle tracking device will be lowered.
 
Other than portable, battery-powered tracking devices, there are two types of tracking devices you can install on a vehicle: plug&play trackers that can be inserted into the **OBD-II port**and **hardwired trackers**.
 
Each tracking device has its unique software and installation process. Make sure to follow the manual instructions carefully. After you install the device, you need to check if the tracking device is working correctly and transmitting location data. You can use a mobile app on your smartphone to view the real-time location of your vehicle anytime, anywhere.
 
**Summing Up**
**Installing GPS tracker in car** is straightforward, and you can refer to this **GPS tracker installation guide** if you face any difficulty. With precise location details, you know the whereabouts of your loved ones or your drivers, giving maximum peace of mind.
 
Use zip ties or velcro tapes to firmly secure the tracker and keep itaway from metal or heat-producing surfaces. Besides the dashboard, youcan place the tracker underneath seats but ensure the signal quality isgood.
 
I have a tracker already fitted to my vehicle which I only discovered after purchasing it 2 years ago. It is a Cobra AT 2216. Can I use your software to track this device rather than pay for a GPS subscription?
 
Hi, what are the dimensions of the DB1-Lite and how long is the interface cabling? Is the Geofence easily adjustable? IE If i park my motorcycle at work can i change the Geofence location and then change it back to home when i return? Or can more than one Geo fence be set up?  
Thank you
 
When using the 104pro with external antennas you will need to switch the antenna switch to EXT. The antennas only receive a signal through the antenna at the end and not the cable. Both external antennas will need to be connected. The GPS antenna needs to be positioned with the plastic dome facing upwards only covered by plastic and glass. The GSM antenna can be positioned either vertically or horizontally but should ideally be positioned at least 10cm away from the GPS antenna again only covered by plastic and glass.
 
Hi Jeremy, Thank you for your question. We recommend wiring the DB2 to a permanent power feed in the vehicle. This means the tracker will be able to detect towing and vibrations when you are away from the vehicle. The DB2 can be wired to an ignition live is this is not possible but this does mean you will loose these features.
 
Hi, just joined your good selves, and purchased the Spytrack Nano Portable GPS Tracker with hard wire kit, idea is to put it in our caravan, but it was not until I watched your (very helpful) video that saw it has to be connected to the battery, I fear if they see the wiring wont they find the tracker? I thought when I purchased it, maybe you could wire it in some where discreet on the caravan. What would be the best thing to do?
 
I got the DB2 a couple of months ago, not fit it yet due to lockdown , had concerns about it running the battery down ?.  
am fitting it in a landrover defender. the battery is located under the passenger seat in a box. if I fitted it there do you think I might have issues with the signal?
 
The DB2 goes to sleep when stationary to save power. The tracker automatically wakes up when movement, vibrations or a voltage change on the vehicle is detected. Once installed using the GPSlive App you will be able to remotely monitor the voltage of your vehicles battery as well as set up alerts for if power is lost or becomes too low. The DB2 features the latest high gain GNSS GPS module enabling it to pick up a good GPS signal even when the line of sight to the sky is obscured.
